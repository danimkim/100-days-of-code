## Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

### Start Date

14 July, 2025. _Tina Kim_

### Additional Rules

1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
3. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
4. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
