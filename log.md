### Today's Progress

Learned asynchronous JavaScript - Callback, Promise

### Thoughts

I studied callbacks and promises to understand the basics of asynchronous processing in JavaScript. I haven’t fully grasped both concepts yet. I used to think of a callback function as simply a function passed as an argument and executed, but I realized once again that it plays a crucial role in JavaScript’s asynchronous processing. As for promises, I’m still not familiar with the syntax, so it took me some time to solve the practice problems. I think I should also revisit the background of why promises were introduced.

### Today's Progress

Worked on my personal project, No more bookmarks. Added basic page styling and UI components.

### Thoughts

With the help of v0, I added basic page structures and UI components. There’s currently an issue with file paths, so the styles aren’t being applied correctly, but I think I’ll be able to fix it soon. I kind of regret not creating the GitHub repository for this project using the project files generated by v0 from the start. Still, thanks to AI, I was able to build the UI quickly, which has been really helpful.
