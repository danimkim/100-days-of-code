### Today's Progress

Learned asynchronous JavaScript - Callback, Promise

### Thoughts

I studied callbacks and promises to understand the basics of asynchronous processing in JavaScript. I haven’t fully grasped both concepts yet. I used to think of a callback function as simply a function passed as an argument and executed, but I realized once again that it plays a crucial role in JavaScript’s asynchronous processing. As for promises, I’m still not familiar with the syntax, so it took me some time to solve the practice problems. I think I should also revisit the background of why promises were introduced.
