# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: 14 July, 2025

### Today's Progress

Learned asynchronous JavaScript - Callback, Promise

### Thoughts

I studied callbacks and promises to understand the basics of asynchronous processing in JavaScript. I haven’t fully grasped both concepts yet. I used to think of a callback function as simply a function passed as an argument and executed, but I realized once again that it plays a crucial role in JavaScript’s asynchronous processing. As for promises, I’m still not familiar with the syntax, so it took me some time to solve the practice problems. I think I should also revisit the background of why promises were introduced.

## Day 1: 15 July, 2025

### Today's Progress

Worked on my personal project, No more bookmarks. Added basic page styling and UI components.

### Thoughts

With the help of v0, I added basic page structures and UI components. There’s currently an issue with file paths, so the styles aren’t being applied correctly, but I think I’ll be able to fix it soon. I kind of regret not creating the GitHub repository for this project using the project files generated by v0 from the start. Still, thanks to AI, I was able to build the UI quickly, which has been really helpful.

## Day 2: 16 July, 2025

### Today's Progress

Tried to figure out why tailwind doesn't work on the project and found out the reason: the major changes between v3 and v4.

### Thoughts

I initially wanted to copy and paste the design generated by v0 directly into my local project folder and start working, but v0 uses Tailwind v3, while I preferred to use the more stable and up-to-date v4. However, due to major changes between v3 and v4, it became difficult to use the v0-generated source code as-is. Even after trying various changes to the postcss.config.mjs file, following suggestions from Cursor and GPT, nothing worked. It turned out that due to config issues, Tailwind wasn’t generating any CSS output, and the upgrade from v3 to v4 wasn’t something that could be resolved with a simple config tweak. I ended up spending the entire afternoon troubleshooting, and now I think the best way forward is to just use the full setup that v0 generates, including package.json, and rebuild the project from there. Although the initial page load is noticeably slower—possibly due to the UI library—using it still seems worthwhile, since building a design system from scratch isn’t realistic for me. It’s more efficient to use existing tools to save development time.
